# Backstopper - testonly-springboot2-webflux

Backstopper is a framework-agnostic API error handling and (optional) model validation solution for Java 7 and greater.

This submodule contains tests to verify that the 
[backstopper-spring-web-flux](../../backstopper-spring-web-flux) module's functionality works as expected in 
Spring Boot 2 WebFlux (Netty) environments, for both classpath-scanning and direct-import Backstopper configuration 
use cases.
