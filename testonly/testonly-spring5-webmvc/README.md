# Backstopper - testonly-spring5-webmvc

Backstopper is a framework-agnostic API error handling and (optional) model validation solution for Java 7 and greater.

This submodule contains tests to verify that the [backstopper-spring-web-mvc](../../backstopper-spring-web-mvc) 
module's functionality works as expected in Spring 5 environments, for both classpath-scanning and direct-import
Backstopper configuration use cases.

See the [base project README.md](../../README.md), [User Guide](../../USER_GUIDE.md), and Backstopper repository 
source code and javadocs for all further information.
